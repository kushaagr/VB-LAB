# VB-LAB code

This repository is used to store and view all code taught in VB-LAB class, 
for anyone to review or revisit what was taught.

I update this repo. the moment LAB session ends.


## Table of Contents:

| Form   | Function |
| ------ | -------- |
| Form 1 | Single input basic calculator |
| Form 2 | Two-variable Calculator with Error-Provider control |
| Form 3<sup>[\[1\]](#footnote1)</sup> | Full-fledged 9-button Calculator application |
| Form 4<sup>[\[2\]](#footnote2)</sup> | Custom Functionality for Form3 |

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: The code in Form3.vb is heavily modified from what was taught in LAB. The original code could be found in [Form3#1.vb](./WindowsApplication1/Form3%231.vb) file.  
<a name="footnote2">2</a>: I created this form to add some additional functionality in my Calculator application (Form3), and is thus unrelated to what was taught in LAB.  
<a name="footnote3">3</a>: Code isn't complete yet, some functions are broken.
